"Outliers are sample values that cause surprise in relation to the majority of the sample" (W.N. Venables and B.D. Ripley. 2002. Modern applied statistics with S. New York: Springer, p.119).

Crucially, surprise is in the mind of the beholder and is dependent on some tacit or explicit model of the data. There may be another model under which the outlier is not surprising at all, say if the data really are lognormal or gamma rather than normal.

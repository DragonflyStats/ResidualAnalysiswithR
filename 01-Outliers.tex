\section{Outliers and Influential Observations}
\subsection{Outliers}

Data points that diverge in a big way from the overall pattern are called outliers. There are four ways that a data point might be considered an outlier.
%---------------------------------------------------------%

\begin{itemize}
	\item It could have an extreme X value compared to other data points.
	\item It could have an extreme Y value compared to other data points.
	\item It could have extreme X and Y values.
	\item It might be distant from the rest of the data, even without extreme X or Y values.
\end{itemize}
%---------------------------------------------------------%

After a regression line has been computed for a group of data, a point which lies far from the line (and thus has a large residual value) is known as an outlier. Such points may represent erroneous data, or may indicate a poorly fitting regression line. If a point lies far from the other data in the horizontal direction, it is known as an influential observation. The reason for this distinction is that these points have may have a significant impact on the slope of the regression line.
